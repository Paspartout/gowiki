# GoWiki

GoWiki starts out as an extensions to the 
[golang.org web application](https://golang.org/doc/articles/wiki/) tutorial.
The idea behind it is to implement a simple file based wiki web application
that can serve wikis from [vimwiki](https://github.com/vimwiki/vimwiki) in
the markdown format.

You may take a look at the todo.md for what I plan to implement.
